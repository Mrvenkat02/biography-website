        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I was born in Karimnagar on May 2, 2002. My father's name is Ramu, he is my strength and my hero. No words for my father. My mother's name is Swapna, she cares for me a lot. My one and only who cares for me a lot. I love my mother. My younger brother's name is Krishna, he is very supportive of me.</p>
        <p>I studied in Paramitha High School from nursery to 10th. From nursery to 10th, these are my memorable moments in my life. This is my best school and I got a 9.0 GPA in 10th SSC. This is my first success in my life. My intermediate at Alphores Junior College was somewhat good but I enjoyed it a lot. I failed in Maths in IPE (Inter Public Examinations) but I never lost hope. I tried and studied hard for that and finally, I passed by God's grace.</p>
        <p>Coming to B-Tech, lots of memories and nothing can vanish from my mind. I pursued B-Tech at Marri Laxman Reddy Institute of Technology and Management from 2020 to 2024. But one negative thing happened in my life, I am still writing the M2 exam, this is my bad luck. But I have enjoyed 4 years with my best friends. One miracle happened in my life, that is Vaishu who cares for me a lot and fights for me a lot. The biggest wonder is she is my one and only wife, I love my wife. In 4 years of B-Tech, I lived in the college hostel for 3 years. Memorable moments for me. After completing my B-Tech, my financial problems increased, no job for me and no income/wages for my dad. Many debts for my dad, totally a loss for my dad but we stay strong moving forward, better days are coming.</p>
        <p>My main goal is to get a job and earn as much as possible and give it to my father to let the debts vanish. After getting rich, I have to convince Vaishu's family and marry her. This is my biography. Signing off, Sriramoju Venkat Ramana.</p>
